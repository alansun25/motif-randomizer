# motif-randomizer
This Python script takes an input graph and randomizes it by increasing or decreasing 
the frequency of a partiular triadic motif, while preserving degree sequence. Users can
input a graph as a text file, select a motif of interest, and specify whether to
increase or decrease the frequency of the motif. Characterstics of the original graph and 
the randomized graph are then analyzed, such as average clustering coefficient, 
assortativity coefficient, average shortest path length, etc.
